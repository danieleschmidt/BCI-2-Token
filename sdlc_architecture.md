# Enhanced SDLC Demo Architecture
## Comprehensive AI-powered Development for BCI-2-Token

### Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive AI-powered Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) framework for the BCI-2-Token brain-computer interface project, featuring full agent coordination, automated testing, and production deployment.

## Core Components

### 1. Agent Coordination System
```
AI Agent Orchestra
├── Requirements Agent - Analyzes and refines project requirements
├── Architecture Agent - Designs system architecture and patterns
├── Implementation Agent - Writes code following best practices
├── Testing Agent - Creates comprehensive test suites
├── Security Agent - Performs security analysis and hardening
├── Performance Agent - Optimizes for speed and efficiency
├── Documentation Agent - Maintains up-to-date documentation
└── Deployment Agent - Manages CI/CD and production deployment
```

### 2. Development Workflow
```
Requirement Analysis → Architecture Design → Implementation → Testing → Security Review → Performance Optimization → Documentation → Deployment
        ↓                    ↓                ↓           ↓            ↓                    ↓                    ↓              ↓

```

### 3. Technology Stack

#### Core BCI Components
- **Signal Processing**: MNE-Python, SciPy, NumPy
- **Neural Networks**: PyTorch, Transformers, Diffusers
- **Privacy**: Opacus (Differential Privacy), CrypTen
- **Real-time**: asyncio, WebRTC, gRPC

#### Development Infrastructure
- **Testing**: pytest, pytest-asyncio, pytest-cov, hypothesis
- **Type Checking**: mypy, pydantic
- **Code Quality**: ruff, black, pre-commit
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, Docker, Kubernetes
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry

### 4. Agent Implementation Strategy

Each agent operates with:
- **Context Awareness**: Full project understanding
- **Collaborative Intelligence**: Inter-agent communication
- **Quality Gates**: Automated validation at each step
- **Continuous Learning**: Improvement from feedback loops

### 5. Testing Framework
```
Unit Tests → Integration Tests → End-to-End Tests → Performance Tests → Security Tests → Compliance Tests
     ↓              ↓                   ↓                  ↓                ↓                ↓
[Component]    [API/Service]      [User Workflow]     [Load/Stress]    [Penetration]   [Privacy/Ethics]
```

### 6. Production Pipeline
```
Development → Staging → Pre-Production → Production
     ↓           ↓           ↓              ↓
